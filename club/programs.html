        <h1>Junior Olympic (JO) Team</h1>
        <p> &nbsp; This group is the top tier of our “Junior Olympic” travel team. The athletes in this group train 6 days per week and 
        attend Local, Regional, Zone, National, and, if qualified, International competitions. These athletes are the “ambassadors” of our 
        team. This group is made up of proven competitors and potential National qualifiers.  This group has a 1 year financial and 
        competition commitment, but will be billed monthly. Please consult the SCD Fee Schedule for specific prices.  This group is by 
        coach’s invitation only.</p>

        <h1>Lessons Program</h1>
        <p> &nbsp; The lessons program is a basic introduction to the sport of diving for children age 13 and under who can successfully
        swim one length of the diving pool unassisted.  This program teaches the basic movements of diving through instruction on the
        ground and in the water.  Divers in this program will be hand-spotted by the instructor to ensure maximal safety on the diving
        boards and in the water.  This class meets one day per week for one hour at a time.  This class operates on a ten-week session 
        system. All new divers (age 13 and under) will be required to take at least one session of lessons.  Divers will be evaluated at 
        the end of the session to determine their placement into our developmental program.   Divers in this program will be able to 
        attend local association level meets.  Please consult the SCD Fee Schedule for information on the cost of this program.</p>

        <h1>Developmental Program</h1>
        <h3>Bronze Group</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;The bronze group is the first step towards transitioning athletes from recreational divers to competitive (JO) divers.
        Athletes from the lessons program who show a strong potential to succeed in the sport of diving (both physically and mentally) 
        will be asked to join the bronze group.  Divers in the bronze group will learn the foundational skills necessary to prepare them 
        for higher level diving.  The bronze groups practice two days per week for one hour at a time.  Quarterly evaluations will be held
        to determine whether or not an athlete is ready to be moved up a group.  Divers in the developmental program will be able to
        attend local association level meets.  Please consult the SCD Fee Schedule for information on the cost of this program.</p>
        <h3>Silver Group</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;The silver group is designed for athletes who have mastered the foundational skills learned in the bronze group.  Divers
        in the silver group will begin learning their voluntary dives along with learning how to somersault and twist.  The silver groups 
        practice three days per week for one hour at a time.  Quarterly evaluations will be held to determine whether or not an athlete is
        ready to be moved up a group.  Divers in the developmental program will be able to attend local association level meets.  Please 
        consult the SCD Fee Schedule for information on the cost of this program.</p>
        <h3>Gold Group</h3>
        <p> &nbsp;The gold group is considered the “pre competitive team”.  Athletes in this group will begin learning a competitive dive 
        list necessary to become a JO level diver.  The gold groups practice three days per week for one and a half hours at a time. 
        Quarterly evaluations will be held to determine whether or not an athlete is ready to be moved up a group.  Divers in the 
        developmental program will be able to attend local association level meets.  Please consult the SCD Fee Schedule for information
        on the cost of this program.</p>

        year round to better prepare for their high school diving season.  All new divers to the program ages 14 and over will placed in 
        the high school group first, and later evaluated to determine whether or not they will be  placed in the developmental or JO 
        program.  The high school groups practice two days per week for one and a half hours at a time.  Divers in the high school program 
        will be able to attend local association level meets.  Please consult the SCD Fee Schedule for information on the cost of this
