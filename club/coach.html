        <h2>Todd Spohn<span class="text-muted"> head coach</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Coach Todd has served as Head Coach at Santa Clara since October of 2011. Over the past year the club has grown tremendously and has
        accomplished great things. This past Summer Santa Clara Diving reached new heights, placing 7th at the Age Group National Championships!</p> 
        <p>Todd served as Interim Head Coach of the USA Diving National Training Center in Indianapolis in 2011.  During his time at the NTC, he coached
        2011 Junior National Champions Steele Johnson, Dashiell Enos and Sarah Bacon, as well as 2008 Olympian Thomas Finchum.  Prior to this, Todd was the
        Head Coach for the Mission Viejo Nadadores from 2006 to 2011. Under his leadership, the Nadadores climbed from 38th place up to 4th place at Junior 
        Nationals.</p>
        <p>Todd began his coaching career at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in 1986 where he coached both college and club diving for over 20 years.
        During that time Todd was named Mid-American Conference Diving Coach of the Year eleven times. Three of his divers swept the diving events at the
        MAC Championships, earning MAC Diver of the Year honors and Miami Athlete of the Year accolades in their respective seasons.</p>
        <p>Spohn earned his bachelor’s degree in 1986 and his master’s degree in sport studies in 1993, both from Miami. During his diving career at Miami,

        <h2>Mark Butcher<span class="text-muted"> coach</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Coach Mark began his coaching career in 1998 when he formed a small diving club called Crown Point Diving Club, in a small town 35
        miles southeast of Chicago, Illinois. In 2001 Coach Mark was invited to move to Indianapolis to help grow the Indianapolis Starz Diving Club as the
        first Satellite Coach. During his tenure in Indianapolis, Coach Mark coached and mentored numerous US Diving Junior National qualifiers and
        finalists, and was named the Starz Diving Club Coach of the Year in 2005. While in Indianapolis, Mark was fortunate to work with some of the 
        greatest minds in diving, including current USA Diving National Training Center Head Coach, John Wingfield. In November of 2005, Mark moved to
        Oklahoma City and formed Dive Oklahoma. In his short tenure in Oklahoma, Dive Oklahoma produced many Junior National qualifiers and finalists, and 1
        US Diving Senior National finalist, and finished 5th as a team at the US Diving West National Championships. Mark is also the Head Diving Coach for
         the San Jose State University Spartans.</p>
